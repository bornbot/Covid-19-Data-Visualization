## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus. The project uses Python for data processing and visualization.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is assumed to be in CSV format and should contain COVID-19 data such as cases, deaths, and recoveries for multiple countries and regions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/covid19-data-visualization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd covid19-data-visualization
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook 'COvid-19 Data visualisation.ipynb'
    ```

## Code Explanation

The code in the Jupyter notebook is structured as follows:

### 1. Importing Libraries
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    ```
    These libraries are essential for data manipulation and visualization.

### 2. Loading the Dataset
    ```python
    data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset/covid19_data.csv')
    data.head()
    ```
    This code loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and displays the first few rows to ensure it has been loaded correctly.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    ```python
    data = data.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
    data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])  # Convert date column to datetime
    ```
    This code cleans the data by removing rows with missing values and converting the date column to datetime format.

### 4. Visualizing the Data
    ```
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
    sns.lineplot(x='date', y='cases', hue='country', data=data)
    plt.title('COVID-19 Cases Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Number of Cases')
    plt.legend(title='Country')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    ```
    This code creates a line plot to visualize the number of COVID-19 cases over time for different countries.

## Results

The line plot provides a visual representation of the trends in COVID-19 cases over time across different countries. This helps in understanding the spread and impact of the virus in various regions.
