## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus. The project uses Python for data processing and visualization.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
<br>
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be in CSV format and should contain COVID-19 data such as cases, deaths, and recoveries for multiple countries and regions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/covid19-data-visualization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd covid19-data-visualization
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook 'COvid-19 Data visualisation.ipynb'
    ```

## Code Explanation

The code in the Jupyter notebook is structured as follows:

### 1. Importing Libraries
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    ```
    These libraries are essential for data manipulation and visualization.

### 2. Loading the Dataset
    ```python
    data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset/covid19_data.csv')
    data.head()
    ```
    This code loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and displays the first few rows to ensure it has been loaded correctly.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    ```python
    data = data.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
    data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])  # Convert date column to datetime
    ```
    This code cleans the data by removing rows with missing values and converting the date column to datetime format.

### 4. Visualizing the Data
    ```python
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
    sns.lineplot(x='date', y='cases', hue='country', data=data)
    plt.title('COVID-19 Cases Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Number of Cases')
    plt.legend(title='Country')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    ```
    This code creates a line plot to visualize the number of COVID-19 cases over time for different countries.

## Results

The line plot provides a visual representation of the trends in COVID-19 cases over time across different countries. This helps in understanding the spread and impact of the virus in various regions.

## How to Create and Edit `README.md` in VS Code

1. **Open VS Code**: Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Create a New File**:
   - Go to `File` > `New File` or press `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (Mac).

3. **Save the File as `README.md`**:
   - Go to `File` > `Save As` or press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (Mac).
   - In the save dialog, name the file `README.md` and choose the directory where you want to save it.

4. **Paste the Content**:
   - Copy the content provided above.
   - Paste it into the newly created `README.md` file in VS Code.

5. **Save the File**:
   - Save the file again by pressing `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (Mac).

## No Need for HTML Tags

Markdown files (`.md`) use a simple, plain-text syntax that is easy to write and read. There is no need to use HTML tags unless you want to include advanced formatting that Markdown does not support natively. The content provided is already in Markdown format, which VS Code supports natively.

## Viewing the Markdown Preview

To view how your Markdown file will look when rendered:

1. **Open the Markdown Preview**:
   - In VS Code, with your `README.md` file open, press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) to open the Markdown preview.
   - Alternatively, right-click on the editor tab and select `Open Preview`.

2. **Side-by-Side Editing**:
   - You can split the editor to see the Markdown file and the preview side by side. Press `Ctrl+K V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K V` (Mac).
